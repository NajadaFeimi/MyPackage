Title: Exploring the possibilities while developing a package for the first time

Description: This package has 3 functions: fit_model, plot_model and plot stats. The fit model fits a lm model to the diamonds
   dataset, then its coefficients are used to plot the scatterplot in plot_model which shows the relation between carat and 
   target variable price. I also wanted to build a fancier plot showing different statistical relations between the features
   of the dataset. For this purpose I created another function displaying jittery boxplots for each diamond cut colored by
   the clarity fo the diamonds. This is an informative plot showing relations for most of the features of the dataset.
